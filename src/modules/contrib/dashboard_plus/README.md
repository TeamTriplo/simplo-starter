Dashboard Plus
==============

This module does two things:

  * Provides the option to make all dashboard blocks collapsible (on by default).

  * Provides a set of additional blocks that can be (optionally) placed on the Dashboard provided by Backdrop CMS. 

At this point, we are looking for good ideas for blocks to include in this module, please use the issue queue to submit requests.
